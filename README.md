## Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis: Cost & Precision Analysis

### Current Manual Diagnosis System:
- **Method**: Manual diagnosis by specialists.
- **Accuracy**: Ranges between 55% to 65%.
- **Cost Factors**: Complexity, analysts' fatigue, and costs associated with devices and payroll.
- **Diagnosis Cost**: Approx. $1,000 per diagnosis.
  
### Pricing Model:
- **Above 50% Precision**: Minimum charge of $500, plus $500 for every additional 5% precision.
  - **Example**: 55% precision costs the client $1,000.
- **Up to 50% Precision**: No charge to the client.

### New Model:
- **Accuracy**: Ranges between 74.54% to 76.6%.
- **Potential Profit (70,000 patients)**:
  - **Worst-Case**: $171.7 million profit.
  - **Best-Case**: $186.2 million profit.
- **Comparison with Today's Procedure**:
  - **Best-case using Current Method**: $105 million profit.
  - **Potential Additional Profit**: Up to $81.2 million, or 77.3% increase.

### Conclusion:
The new diagnostic model offers a significant potential increase in profit due to higher accuracy, as compared to the current manual diagnosis procedure.
